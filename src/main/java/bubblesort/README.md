# Bubble Sort

1. start from the beginning of the list with `i`
2. compare the value of `i` and `i + 1`, swap their position if they are not in right order, until `i` reaches the end of list
3. now the largest/smallest value should be in its right position, and exclude it from next loop
4. repeat step 1 and 2 until there are no more values need to be compared
